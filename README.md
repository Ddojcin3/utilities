Everything from introductions, code for my students, connectors, to rather tricky helper scripts

This is my repository for all the scripts I use but do not consider my main focus. They range from little timers and loggers you can add to you regular scripts, Python tutorials, SQL selects, to database connectors, and system integration tools. Here you will find also introductions to Python, Numpy, Theano, TensorFlow, etc.

If you need help on how to run files when you download them, you can find more detailed instructions below:

# HOW to open .py and .ipynb files

You need to get Anaconda first from https://www.continuum.io/downloads. I usually use Python 3.x, but I do have some codes that are Python 2.7. In any case, all of the introduction codes and all the IPython notebooks are Python 3.x, so choose that version of Anaconda when installing. Later on you will get the 2.7, but by that time you will be comfortable enough to be able to do it yourself.Â 

## PY files
These are regular Python files, you open and edit them with Vim, Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime, Emacs... any simple text editor will do. If you do not know which one to use, I suggest Notepad++ or Sublime. You can also edit them in standard Python IDE's (which are super-powered text editors) like IDLE, Spyder, PyCharm.

So, when you have a myFile.py file, you open and edit it with Notepad++. When you need to run it, open the command prompt and type "python myFile.py", and it will run (if you did not make any mistakes in the code).

## IPYNB files
You will also need Anaconda for this type of files. Suppose you have a file myNotebook.ipynb on your Desktop. Then, open the command prompt, type in "jupyter notebook" or "ipython notebook". It will open a window in your default web browser and there you should navigate to your Desktop and click on the myNotebook.ipynb file to open it.

Once open, you will have text cells and code cells. You can modify both by double clicking on them and writing, and to execute them you press Shift+Enter, and it will run if you did not make any mistake in the code.
